# DesignPatterns
Contains the code, mistakes discussed and the modifications described in the book, Head First Design Patterns.
This repository at its root level will contain different folders of the form **&lt;Exercise No.&gt;-&lt;PatternName&gt;**. Each folder 
will have a Readme.md describing the requirement that lead to changes in the design.
Additionally , the Readme.md will contain three sections namely Description, Modifications, Rectifications and Mistakes.

1. **Description**

   This section will describe the exercise that will be used to describe and use the design pattern (in the book).

2. **Changing requirements**

   This section will describe the changes that were asked by the client (in the book).
   
3. **Modifications**

   This section will describe the changes done to incorporate the requirements that came along (in the book).

4. **Mistakes identified**

   This section will describe the problems that arrived when we did modifications to incorporate the requirements (in the book).
   
5. **Rectifications**

   This section will describe the changes that we do to solve the mistakes that we did after doing the modifications.
   
Since the design process is an incremental approach, so that is why we get a requirement, we change/modify something and we do
some mistakes and we rectify them. Such is the flow of this Readme document placed in every folder in the root directory.
